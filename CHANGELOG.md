## 0.5.1

* Sprinkles two instance variables to the custom transaction manager that cribs
  its implementation from ActiveRecord::TestFixtures (see f75f280)
  [#88](https://github.com/testdouble/cypress-rails/issues/88)
  [#89](https://github.com/testdouble/cypress-rails/pull/89)

## 0.5.0

* Add hook `after_server_start`
  [#63](https://github.com/testdouble/cypress-rails/pull/63)
* Fix namespace bug
  [#64](https://github.com/testdouble/cypress-rails/pull/64)

## 0.4.2

* Add support to Rails 6.1 ([#52](https://github.com/testdouble/cypress-rails/issue/52))

## 0.4.1

* Add backcompat for Ruby 2.4
  ([#47](https://github.com/testdouble/cypress-rails/pull/47))

## 0.4.0

* Add a `CYPRESS_RAILS_HOST` option that allows a hostname to be specified (as
opposed to 127.0.0.1). Puma will still bind to 127.0.0.1, but Cypress will use
the hostname in its `baseUrl`, which may be necessary for some folks' tests to
work

## 0.3.0

* Add a `CYPRESS_RAILS_BASE_PATH` option which will be appended to the
  `CYPRESS_BASE_URL` option that cypress-rails sets when launching cypress
  commands. Apps that set `baseUrl` to something other than "/" can set this env
  var to match for consistent behavior (or else set it using Cypress.config in a
  support file)

## 0.2.0

* If `RAILS_ENV` has been explicitly set when the CLI or rake task is run,
respect that set value instead of overriding it to "test"

## 0.1.3

* Improve behavior of SIGINT (Ctrl-C) so a traceback isn't printed and stdout
  isn't flushed after the program exits

## 0.1.2

* Drop the hard deps on capybara and selenium-webdrivers (instead inlining
  portions of the Capybara server logic). Additionally, add a hard dep on puma
  since this gem is useless without it

## 0.1.1

* Fix the `before_server_stop` hook by rolling back transactions first so that
  it can clean out test data

## 0.1.0

* **[Breaking]** Remove `CypressRails::TestCase`. Use `rake cypress:run` instead
* **[Breaking]** cypress-rails now starts a transaction immediately after
  launching the server, which could result in other processes not being able
  to observe your changes. To revert to the old behavior, set the env var
  `CYPRESS_RAILS_TRANSACTIONAL_SERVER=false`
* Add configuration variables `CYPRESS_RAILS_DIR`,
  `CYPRESS_RAILS_TRANSACTIONAL_SERVER`. Rename port and Cypress CLI forwarding
  to `CYPRESS_RAILS_PORT` and `CYPRESS_RAILS_CYPRESS_OPTS`
* Add test data configuration hooks (to be run in an initializer):
  * `CypressRails.hooks.before_server_start`
  * `CypressRails.hooks.after_transaction_start`
  * `CypressRails.hooks.after_state_reset` - after a transaction rollback
  * `CypressRails.hooks.before_server_stop` - called in an `at_exit` hook

## 0.0.4

* Started a changelog
